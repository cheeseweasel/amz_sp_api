```ruby
# load the gem
require 'amz_sp_api'

api_instance = AmzSpApi::FinancesApiModel::DefaultApi.new
opts = { 
  posted_after: DateTime.parse('2013-10-20T19:20:30+01:00'), # DateTime | The response includes financial events posted on or after this date. This date must be in [ISO 8601](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/iso-8601) date-time format. The date-time must be more than two minutes before the time of the request.

This date must be in [ISO 8601](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/iso-8601) date-time format.  The date-time must be later than `PostedAfter` and more than two minutes before the request was submitted. If `PostedAfter` and `PostedBefore` are more than 180 days apart, the response is empty.  **Default:** Two minutes before the time of the request.
  marketplace_id: 'marketplace_id_example', # String | The identifier of the marketplace from which you want to retrieve transactions. The marketplace ID is the globally unique identifier of a marketplace. To find the ID for your marketplace, refer to [Marketplace IDs](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/marketplace-ids).

  related_identifier_name: 'related_identifier_name_example', # String | The name of the `relatedIdentifier`.  **Possible values:**  * `FINANCIAL_EVENT_GROUP_ID`: the financial event group ID associated with the transaction.   **Note:**   FINANCIAL_EVENT_GROUP_ID is the only `relatedIdentifier` with filtering capabilities at the moment. While other `relatedIdentifier` values will be included in the response when available, they cannot be used for filtering purposes.
  related_identifier_value: 'related_identifier_value_example', # String | The value of the `relatedIdentifier`.
  next_token: 'next_token_example' # String | The response includes `nextToken` when the number of results exceeds the specified `pageSize` value. To get the next page of results, call the operation with this token and include the same arguments as the call that produced the token. To get a complete list, call this operation until `nextToken` is null. Note that this operation can return empty pages.
