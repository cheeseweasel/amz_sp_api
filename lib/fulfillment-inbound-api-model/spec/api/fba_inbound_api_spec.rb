  # unit tests for confirm_transport
  # Confirms that the seller accepts the Amazon-partnered shipping estimate, agrees to allow Amazon to charge their account for the shipping cost, and requests that the Amazon-partnered carrier ship the inbound shipment.  Prior to calling the confirmTransport operation, you should call the getTransportDetails operation to get the Amazon-partnered shipping estimate.  Important: After confirming the transportation request, if the seller decides that they do not want the Amazon-partnered carrier to ship the inbound shipment, you can call the voidTransport operation to cancel the transportation request. Note that for a Small Parcel shipment, the seller has 24 hours after confirming a transportation request to void the transportation request. For a Less Than Truckload/Full Truckload (LTL/FTL) shipment, the seller has one hour after confirming a transportation request to void it. After the grace period has expired the seller&#x27;s account will be charged for the shipping cost.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 2 | 30 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available.

  # unit tests for create_inbound_shipment_plan
  # Returns one or more inbound shipment plans, which provide the information you need to create one or more inbound shipments for a set of items that you specify. Multiple inbound shipment plans might be required so that items can be optimally placed in Amazon&#x27;s fulfillment network—for example, positioning inventory closer to the customer. Alternatively, two inbound shipment plans might be created with the same Amazon fulfillment center destination if the two shipment plans require different processing—for example, items that require labels must be shipped separately from stickerless, commingled inventory.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 2 | 30 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available.
